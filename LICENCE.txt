This code is currently distributed under the GPLv3 licence as
required by the following libraries used and distributed with this
code:
  - ALGLIB
  - FADBAD++
These libraries are provided in the libs/ directory and their
original licences are included.


The hope is that a future release of this code will use different and
less restrictive libraries so that this code can be utilized by
anyone in full without being plagued by "copyleft" restrictions.
However, in the meantime, these libraries work well and are easy to
use for prototyping purposes.
